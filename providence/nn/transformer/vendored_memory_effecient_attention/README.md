This code was vendored for the sole intent of getting something running in our (somewhat) restricted
compute environment ASAP, without clobbering and incumbering our dependency tree by including JAX
as a Providence dependency.

Once the upstream pull request to decouple the main project from JAX (link: TODO) is resolved, we
will import the code from the pip repo.

As this code is unlicensed, we provide attribution to the source repository and hope to cite the paper
when the work proves beneficial to our own.
